              Britannic supplies Ultra Violet sterilizer is very flexible in its
              applications for water treatment. This type of disinfection
              reliably reduces pathogens and the germ count in water. We offer
              an economic, environmental friendly alternative to chemical
              process. There is no need for the addition of chemicals and there
              is no detrimental environmental impact as there are no chemicals
              residuals.

              Moreover, chlorine resistant bacteria such as cryptosporidium,
              giardia can be killed with UV light. UV disinfection is effective
              at wave length between 200 and 300nm. Emitted UV has a powerful
              bactericidal effect. It is absorbed by DNA, breaks up its
              structure and killing living cells. Micro- organisms such as
              viruses, bacteria, yeasts and fungi re destroyed in seconds with
              UV radiation. UV light will not affect the taste, smell or pH
              Value of the drinking water.
