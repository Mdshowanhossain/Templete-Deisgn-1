              Britannic undertakes the design , supply and installations of
              Multimedia filters and the associated peripheral system or
              equipment’s. Multi media Filters are the Pre-filter which improves
              physical, chemical and biological characteristics of water. They
              are designed to remove suspended and colloidal impurities from
              water by passage through a bed of granular medias. 98% of
              suspended solids, bacterial load such as cryprosporidium and
              giardia cysts, pollen, beach sand etc...this can be removed and
              this percentage may high as 99.9% if the pretreatment has been
              given for the raw water. This duty is succeeded when the raw water
              pumped and fills the pores of the filter medium, and the
              impurities are absorbed on the surface of the grains or trapped in
              the openings. The main factors influencing the filtering and
              trapping processes are:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="./images/liz.png" alt="" />
              Suspended particle size: Filtration efficiency improves with
              larger particulate size. Pore size: The space between the grains
              determines the size of particulate that can be trapped.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="./images/liz.png" alt="" />
              Grain shape: Angular grains participate more in the mechanical
              straining process. Filtration velocity: Filtration efficiency
              decreases with increased velocity
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="./images/liz.png" alt="" />
              Temperature of liquid: Increased water temperature, although it
              normally cannot be controlled, results in more efficient
              filtration.

              Chemical properties of the water and particle: A chemical filter
              aid may be added to promote adhesion.
