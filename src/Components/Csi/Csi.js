              Britannic supplies Copper Silver ionization system which is
              Electrically charged copper ions (Cu2+) in the water search for
              particles of opposite polarity, such as bacteria, viruses and
              fungi. Positively charged copper ions form electrostatic compounds
              with negatively charged cell walls of microorganisms. These
              compounds disturb cell wall permeability and cause nutrient uptake
              to fail. Copper ions penetrate the cell wall and as a result they
              will create an entrance for silver ions (Ag+). These penetrate the
              core of the microorganism. Silver ions bond to various parts of
              the cell, such as the DNA and RNA, cellular proteins and
              respiratory enzymes, causing all life support systems in the cell
              to be immobilized. As a result, there is no more cellular growth
              or cell division, causing bacteria to no longer multiply and
              eventually die out. The ions remain active until they are absorbed
              by a microorganism.

              Copper-silver ionization can deactivate Legionella bacteria and
              other microorganisms in slow-running water and still water.
              Legionella bacteria are very susceptive to copper-silver
              ionization. Copper-silver ionization also takes care of bio film.
              Copper remains within the bio film, causing a residual effect. It
              appears that copper-silver ionization addition causes the number
              of Legionella bacteria to diminish. After a short period of time,
              however, the number of Legionella bacteria will rise again because
              they can also be found in the bio film. Copper that stays behind
              in the bio film takes care of these bacteria. When copper and
              silver ions are added to water constantly, the concentration of
              Legionella bacteria remains low. The deactivation rate of
              copper-silver ionization is lower than that of ozone or UV. A
              benefit of copper-silver ionization is that ions remain in the
              water for a long period of time. This causes long-term
              disinfection and protection from recontamination. Copper and
              silver ions remain in the water until they precipitate or absorb
              to bacteria or algae, and are removed from water by filtration
              after that.
